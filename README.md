# mysite-2.0
My new and updated personal website!

This website is build from scratch using React.js, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is deployed using AWS S3 and CloudFront. This was also my first dive into React.js. Although it barely scrapes the surface of what the library is capable of, I learned a lot about designing components and implementing a user interface accoridng to a basic wireframe.
