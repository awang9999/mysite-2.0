                    Hello! I write articles exploring computer science,
                    mathematics, machine learning, and the intersection
                    of them all! Keep reading to see what I have been
                    working on and interested in recently.

generalizes to functions with multiple variables in its domain. This is
unfortunately not a trivial generalization and the definition we provide
will seem cryptic at first. However, we will soon see that the
definition provides several of the conveniences we would expect from the
derivative, and maybe even some additional advantages.'

We will show that this is equivalent to a defining the derivative as the best linear approximator of the function. This setup will lay the foundations for discussing derivatives of matrix-like objects.'

As someone who once struggled while learning it, I hope to write a guide for future students learning matrix calculus in the context of machine learning.'
